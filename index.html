<h3> Readers review </h3>
<p>"Hunger Games is a book with many messages meant to mirror problems in our own society, namely desensitization 
 violence on tv, reality tv shows that blur the lines between real human suffering and being kicked off the island, war, 
famine, haves vs. have nots, just to mention a few. It's a though-provoking read, meant to be discussed and examined by
 children and their parents/teachers."

Taneisha from Australia
"I first read the series when I was 10 and have decided to reread the series now at 15 and was extremely impressed with the underlying message to readers the book conveyed. The book is page-turning, absorbing, fast-paced, and adventurous whilst also giving readers a warning on how dark society can be. I highly recommend this book, especially for those who love the movie as it (as most book-based movies) was quite misleading and left out some beautiful moments highlighted in the book."
